# JHipster registry

This is the [JHipster](http://jhipster.github.io/) registry service, based on [Eureka](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka) and Spring Cloud Config.

## Warning: JHipster 3.0 feature!

This project is to be used with JHipster 3.0, which is not released yet.

If you wish to test this, you need to use our development branch. If you want to do this, don't panic! It's in fact surprisingly easy, just [follow this guide](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#setup) to setup your environment.

## Architecture

The JHipster microservices architecture is supposed to work in the following way:

- The gateway is a JHipster-generated application (using application type `gateway` when you generate it) that handles all Web traffic, and serves the AngularJS application
- The registry is a runtime application, using the usual JHipster structure, on which all applications registers
- Microservices are JHipster-generated application (using application type `microservice` when you generate them), that handle REST requests

When the gateway and the microservices are launched, they will register themselves in the registry (using the `eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone` key in the `src/main/resources/config/application.yml` file.
The gateway will automatically proxy all requests to the microservices, using their application name: for example, when microservices `app1` is registered, it is available on the gateway on the `/app1` URL.

For example, if your gateway is running on `localhost:8080`, you could point to [http://localhost:8080/app1/rest/foos](http://localhost:8080/app1/rest/foos) to
get the `foos` resource served by microservice `app1`. If you're trying to do this with your Web browser, don't forget REST resources are secured
by default in JHipster, so you need to send the correct JWT header (see next point), or remove the security on those URLs in the gateway's `SecurityConfiguration` class.

### Security considerations

For security to work, you need to exchange the JWT secret token between all your applications.

- The default token is unique, and generated by JHipster. It is stored in your `.yo-rc.json` file.
- Tokens are configured with the `jhipster.security.authentication.jwt.secret` key in your `src/main/resources/config/application.yml` file.
- To share this key between all your applications, copy the key from your gateway to all the microservices.
- A good practice is to have a different key in development and production: you could have different keys in your `application-dev.yml` and `application-prod.yml` files, or use a specific environment variable in production.

## Running the registry

To run the application, like any JHipster application, just launch:

    mvn

The registry Web console should be available at [http://127.0.0.1:8761/](http://127.0.0.1:8761/).

The microservices will be registered on the gateway, you can see them on the gateway management screen at [http://127.0.0.1:8080/#/gateway](http://127.0.0.1:8080/#/gateway).

## Tips

### Avoid port conflicts

If you run several JHipster microservices on your machine, don't forget to change their default port (8081) by modifying the
`server.port` key in their `src/main/resources/config/application.yml` file.
